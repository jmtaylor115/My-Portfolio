        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Jared Taylor, I have lived in East Tennessee my entire life. I graduated with honors from Cherokee High School in 2017. I started
                college the following fall at East Tennessee State University, pursuing a degree in Physics. I changed my major after my first semester to 
                Chemistry and again the following semester to Computer Science with a concentration in Information Technology. Changing over to Computer Science 
                was the best decison I think I made. I love programming! Every coding project I do feels so challenging and rewarding. Programming is challenging
                because you will never write perfect code; there will always be at least one bug to find and solve. It is rewarding because when you find those 
                bugs and get them fixed you can finally look at the result of the work you have done. You see an application or a website that you have been 
                working on and it always fills me with a feeling of accomplishment and pride. However, after a year, I took the semester off to work and
                find a way to continue to pay for college. Towards the end of this year, I started this bootcamp to sharpen my skills in coding and gain knowledge 
                about pursuing a career in the field of programming. I currently have close to 2 years of knowledge on programming with knowledge in java, html, and css.
