# My-Portfolio

    With this project, I started working on a portfolio  for future employers to look at. This is definitley a project that I will frequently be revisiting and updating. I tried to crate a nav bar at the top similar to the last project but did not get that down. I also expirienced issues trying to get the page to space correctly. Other than the css issues I encountered, I had a fun time creating a profile for myself for others to read.
